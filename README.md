#  Landmarks

This is a tutorial project following the "Landmarks" learning app from Swift docs:
https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views

This is a learning app only, and intended to gain familiarity with building UI elements, navigating between views and storing state.

Soon we'll get into more complex subjects like building models and mutating/querying data.
